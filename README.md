### lure

Functions in fish shell for my terminal life.
This is the bundle of the functions as fisherman plugin.

### Why this called lure?

> A fishing lure is a type of artificial fishing bait which is designed to attract a fish's attention.

This bundles the functions to use fish shell more confortably.
As a matter of fact, I hope to overwrite the `fish_user_key_binding.fish` file later than `fisherman/fzf` plugin overwriting.
